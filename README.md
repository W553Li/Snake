# Snake

This snake remake was made with the usage/assistance of a coding tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTcIXok9wNY) made by Web Dev Simplified.
Game features such as the game-loop, grid design, and snake functionality was taken from the tutorial whereas other features such as the speed functions, score, and certain controls were designed by myself.
